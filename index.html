      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Stephen Colbert was born on May 13, 1964, in Washington, D.C. The
        youngest of eleven children, he was born to James William Colbert
        Jr., an immunologist, and Lorna Elizabeth Colbert, a homemaker.
        Spending his early years in Bethesda, Maryland, the family later
        moved to James Island, South Carolina, a suburb of Charleston.</p>
      <p>Colbert graduated from Porter-Gaud High School. He originally
        attended Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia as a philosophy major.
        After 2 years, he transferred to Northwestern University. He
        graduated in 1986 with a <em>Bachelor's of Arts</em> in
        Communication.</p>

      <h2>Professional Career</h2>
      <p>Stephen Colbert got his start in comedy performing improv at
        Northwestern. His first job out of college was at the ticket booth
        at The Second City. He took free classes, and was soon on the
        touring company, serving as an understudy for Steve Carell. He
        worked on The Dana Carvey Show and Strangers with Candy with other
        Second City cast members before reaching The Daily Show in 1997.</p>
      <p>Colbert was hired as a "correspondent" for the second season of The
      Daily Show. He played his character as a parody of conservative
        commentators like Bill O'Reilly for several years. His character was
      so successful, that Colbert hosted a spin off of The Daily Show, called
      The Colbert Report, from 2005-2014. Colbert used the same character
        and interview several prominent celebrities and political figures.</p>
      <p>In 2014, it was announced that Colbert would step down from his
        hosting duties at The Colbert Report to replace outgoing Late Show
        on CBS host David Letterman. The first edition hosted by Colbert
        premiered on September 8, 2015 with George Clooney as the guest. The
      show has taken on a much more political focus than that of
        Letterman's. Colbert also created, wrote, and executive produced two
        satirical political cartoon shows, Our Cartoon President and Tooning
        Out the News.</p>
